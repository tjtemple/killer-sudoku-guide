# **Killer Sudoku Guide / Cheat Sheet**

Simple program to create and parse data of number combinations for killer sudoku puzzles.

## What is Killer Sudoku?

Killer sudoku adds boxes to sudoku puzzles which sum up to a certain number. (ex. https://sudoku.com/killer/expert/)
For boxes with 3 or even 4 numbers summing to a number, it can be very useful to know how many/what combinations of numbers are possible to reduce options and solve the puzzle.
