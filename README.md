simple program to create and parse data of number combinations for killer sudoku puzzles 

killer sudoku adds boxes which sum up to a certain number (ex. https://sudoku.com/killer/expert/)
for boxes with 3 or even 4 numbers summing to a number, it can be very useful to know how many/what combinations of numbers are possible to reduce options and solve the puzzle

output is a csv file, which I made into a spreadsheet to make a handy one page cheat sheet
format is sum/digits, so for example 10/3 which is 3 digit combinations that add up to 10: 127, 136, 145, and 235
